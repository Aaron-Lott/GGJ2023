Find our game on the GGJ website at: https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/new-roots-7

A quick deck drawing, decision making game about getting to know your new family as a newly adopted teenager.
Presented with daily family life scenarios, flick left or right to decide how you deal with each situation, baring in mind each decision will influence each family member's trust in you!

"Your days at the orphanage are over as the Willotts family have agreed to take you in.
But as a sceptical teenager, you believe each family member has some secret side to them they dare to share.

Try to build up trust with your new family whilst investigating their well-kept secrets...
And remember, if you don't get along, they may return you to the orphanage like last time!"
